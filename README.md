# F1-DRS-Decision-AI
The DRS Decision AI module is an advanced and exciting subcomponent of a full F1 race strategy AI system. It's a project that blends deep learning (transformers), racecraft understanding, and real telemetry data to make intelligent overtaking decisions, similar to what top-tier F1 drivers like Max Verstappen must do in real time.
